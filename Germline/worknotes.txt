We are interested in the variant calls affecting CDS regions. These include:
```{r}
filter(ExRes, Location2 %in% c("5'UTR-3'UTR", "5'UTR-CDS", "CDS", "CDS-3'UTR")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Location2, fill=SV_type)) +
    geom_bar() +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(x="Gene topology", y="Count")
```
*ExRes focus on the prioritised call set to find variants that are potentially interesting
(but we don't have sufficient info on that)

where to run a huge correlation between two huge continuous variables?
to use geom_hex then.

also: drug mode of action to answer a few related key questions?
