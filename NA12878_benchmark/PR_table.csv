TRENDS:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Precision: Trend presists regardless of coverage level; drops with decreasing coverage except at 6x where precision spiked for all groups (Possibly noise).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. Recall: Manta gives highest recall in acceptable coverage level (35x). Remarkably, even at 18x coverage Manta maintained a 62% recall rate with 48% precision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. At 35x coverage, Manta has the best recall rate while SvABA gave the best Precision/Recall performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Q&A:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Why are there no error bars?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> There aren't because there cannot be. SE=SD/sqrt(n). The bars here represent Recall=n(TP)/|truth set|, not a mean of an array of observations. As a result, this value is absolute with variance 0 ¡X In other words, there is no error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(It either is or isn't),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
