1. part 1 of the presentation is to talk about the benchmark for ~ 1.5 mins
- Use the PR plot
- Can omit Melt and see the effect , or keep it and spend ~30 sec explaining why it has tp=0 for all sets
- [TODO] Can also join Manta and SvABA (two best) together and see if PR is improved in the joint set.
See Slack for details
- [MAYBE] Design the NCaller stat. See Slack


2. Part 2 of the presentation will be about the ExRes analysis based on our benchmarking results
- As in, it will be an example of our benchmarking
- In which we found, for 35x coverage and even with 18x depth (which is 50% of usual average for human WGS?), Manta and SvABA have good PR stats, and they differ a bit
- So would be a good complement to each other?

^[TODO] Formulate that conclusion (Our theme).

- Once formulated, we use that as a "guide" to our ExRes analysis:

- [TODO] Pick e.g. Manta and SvABA calls from the 6 samples
- [TODO] What variants were called?

- [TODO] What variants are of clinical interest? Why?

- Spend about 1 min to talk about your results.

The presentation time frame should look like:
|----Intro 15 sec----|----Benchmarking results (Main 1) 1.15 min----|----Transition to ExRes 15 sec----|
----ExRes analysis results as an example of using our benchmarking results (Main 2) 1 mins----|
----Conclusion 15 sec----|
