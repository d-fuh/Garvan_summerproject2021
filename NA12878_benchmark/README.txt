Notes before proceeding:

1. All VCF files from SvABA needs to be processed first using the instruction in ./SvABA_processing
2. NA12878_benchmark.Rmd is our main benchmarking workflow
3. SV_type plots.Rmd generates graphs on the statistics of the structural variant types detected in NA12878 by the callers benchmarked.
4. Support_read_manta_svaba.Rmd calculates and visualises the support read and total reading depth information from the respective VCF files of Manta and SvABA.
